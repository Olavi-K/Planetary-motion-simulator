# Planetary-motion-simulator
A simple planetary motion simulator I created as part of the course Scientific Computing II at the University of Helsinki.

## Contents
An extensive description of the project can be found in the file report.pdf. The source files are found in the src/ folder. Input files and other files related to running the simulation can be found in the run/ folder. Both folders have their own README.md files that explain their contents in more detail.
